# CCB 2023/24 simulations/usage

The code for the CCB in Dec 2023 is on branch CCB-Dec23 in subdirectory Numbers-2024/

New usage information is in subdirectory usage/

usage requires downloading a csv file by hand from the link at the top that dumps a fifemon summary and then running either monthly.py or monthly.ipynb

# 2024 simulations

The code for 2024 is in subdirectory Numbers-2024

* Uses a jupyter notebook (versioned by date for history) 
  
  -  Example: 2023-06-24.ipynb
  -  LATEST: 2023-11-07.ipynb, mainly added a wall-time plot
 
  -  This implements NDLAr as a separate detector and add retention times and ratios between analysia and reco+sim times for detectors. 

* Which reads a json file (versioned by date for history)
  
  -  Example: DOE23-NDLAr_2023-06-24-2040.json
  -  LATEST: DOE23-NDLAr_2023-11-03-2040.json - has ability to turn of MWC

* The json file has parameters for particular DUNE detectors and running periods. 

* Needs are parametrized by year starting in 2018.  Most year by years are set by

  - 2018-2027
  - 2028-2037
  - 2038-2040

just so  you can figure out which year is which.  

* Units are specified in the json file but are generally PB, MHr, Walltime.  

The notebook uses NumberUtils.py which does things like make plots, calculate cumulative use over multiple years, etc. 

# To run the code:

1. Install jupyter and matplotlib and the DUNE/dune_plot_style code (requires running the setup script to install the dune_plot_style)

2. clone DUNE/CCB-data  - maybe make your own branch while playing around

3. `cd Numbers-2024 directory`
   
4. open DOE23-NDLAr_2023-11-03-2040.json in an editor - save your own version 

6. `jupyter-lab 2023-11-07.ipynb &` will create a webpage with the notebook 
   
7. edit the notebook to point to your version of the json file.  DOE23-NDLAr_2023-11-03-2040.json is an example

8. you can then edit the json file and iterate.  Plots will appear in the notebook and in a subdirectory named after your json file.

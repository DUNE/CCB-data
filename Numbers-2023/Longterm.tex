%This section provides information on the sizes of data samples known to the SAM data catalog as of Nov. 1, 2022.  If a file has multiple copies, that is not shown here.  Tables \ref{tab:MCinSAM} and \ref{tab:DataInSam} show the total across all streams and data tiers while table \ref{tab:LargestSizes} shows the distribution of the largest samples.

\section{Model Details}

This appendix shows the parameters used in the model and plots of all the input and derived quantities as a function of time. 

Resource needs for reconstructed data for a given year are based on the number of events produced over the previous "Reprocess" years.   For ProtoDUNEs that is 2-4 years. 

Simulation resource needs are instead calculated based on a number of simulation events each year. The assumption is that new software versions imply resimulation.

Disk and tape lifetimes for different data types are specified as well as the desirable number of copies. 

The splits parameters make CERN responsible for raw data until 2027 with the collaboration taking over after that point.

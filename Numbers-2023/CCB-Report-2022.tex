\section{Introduction}

This is an annual projection for DUNE CPU and storage needs intended for use at the Computing Contributions Board meeting in December 2022. It projects needs for 2023 onwards. 

The overall computing model  and 2022 projections for DUNE are described in chapters 6-13 of the recent (Oct. 2022) DUNE Conceptual Design Report \cite{DUNE:2022fcw}.   This 

The projection is done using codes at: \href{https://github.com/DUNE/CCB-data/tree/master/Numbers-2023}{https://github.com/DUNE/CCB-data/tree/master/Numbers-2023} from parameters stored in a json file. We use CPU and storage sizes derived from protoDUNE and simulation experience and apply them to projected numbers of events from the various DUNE detectors. 

Details are provided in the appendices while the main body of this note summarizes pledges, usage and projected need for the CCB.

Changes since the last report include:

\begin{itemize}
\item A later start for ProtoDUNE 2 running at CERN.
\item Use of slot time instead of CPU time as our codes often require more memory than is available for a single batch slot. 
\item Revisions to near-term requests based on the 2022 experience including a hold on tape requests from the collaboration during protoDUNE activities. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Disk and Tape}

Generally, raw data are stored on tape at both CERN and FNAL.  Simulation and reconstructed data  have one tape copy at Fermilab and recent reconstructed and simulated samples have one (or two) disk copies with one at Fermilab and one in Europe.  Appendix \ref{storage} gives details on the size and types of data from the SAM data catalog.

\subsection{Disk}
Table \ref{tab:RSEUsage} summarizes the disk utilization known to rucio.  Some sites, notably IN2P3 and TIFR, are not yet fully integrated so do not show up in the rucio reports, while others (PIC) are still being filled.

Figure/Table  \ref{fig:Cumulative-Disk}  summarize the cumulative disk projected by our model. These numbers are used to generate the request for 2023. 

Table \ref{tab:DiskPledges} summarizes the pledges from previous years compared to the actual amounts allocated and used from Table \ref{tab:RSEUsage} .   The 2023 request has been re-evaluated in light of underuse in 2021 and 2022 and should better match the likely capacity of the collaborating sites.  It is however, still higher than 2022 due to ProtoDUNE running and increased simulation for the far and near detectors.

\label{tab:DiskPledges}
\end{table}

\subsection{Tape}

DUNE currently has $\sim$23 PB of data on tape at Fermilab and 5 PB of protoDUNE data as a second copy at CERN.  The UK and the IN2P3 have made tape available but it has not yet been smoothly integrated into our data flow.  We will not be requesting additional tape space from the collaboration until we can use it efficiently. 

Figure and Table  \ref{fig:Cumulative-Tape}  summarize the cumulative disk projected by our model. These numbers are used to generate the requests for 2023. Table \ref{tab:CPUUsage} shows pledges and utilization for 2021-2022 and the request for 2023.

\end{figure}

\section{CPU Needs}

CPU  slot time estimates are created by estimating the number of simulated and raw events taken and then scaling by the measured CPU time on a gpvm corrected for the estimated efficiency (default 70\%) and for a memory utilization factor that takes into account the differing memory needs for different applications and the number of slots needed to satisfy those needs.  Here we assume that reconstruction takes 4000MB, simulation takes 6000MB and actual measured  slot utilization for 2021 and 2022 is best fit by assuming that an average slot has 3000 MB of memory.    We assume that analysis takes the same interactive CPU time but uses only 3000 MB of memory.  

Figure/Table \ref{fig:CoresMain} shows the projected memory weighted wall-time projections through 2026.  This is different than in previous years where memory weighting was not applied. 

Table \ref{tab:CPUUsage} summarizes the pledges\cite{CCB2022} and measured usage using FNAL's statistics\cite{fifemonDUNE}.  The  usage numbers for 2022 are Nov 2021 to Oct 2022. 

Table \ref{tab:EIGSummary} summarizes the statistics for Nov 2021 to Oct 2022 derived from the alternate EIG accounting\cite{EIG2022}.

\section{Information about storage from SAM}\label{storage}

This section provides information on the sizes of data samples known to the SAM data catalog as of Nov. 1, 2022.  If a file has multiple copies, that is not shown here.  Tables \ref{tab:MCinSAM} and \ref{tab:DataInSam} show the total across all streams and data tiers while table \ref{tab:LargestSizes} shows the distribution of the largest samples.

\section{Model Details}

This appendix shows the parameters used in the model and plots of all the input and derived quantities as a function of time. 

Resource needs for reconstructed data for a given year are based on the number of events produced over the previous "Reprocess" years.   For ProtoDUNEs that is 2-4 years. 

Simulation resource needs are instead calculated based on a number of simulation events each year. The assumption is that new software versions imply resimulation.

Disk and tape lifetimes for different data types are specified as well as the desirable number of copies. 

The splits parameters make CERN responsible for raw data until 2027 with the collaboration taking over after that point.

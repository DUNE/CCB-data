This is the directory for 2024 studies.  There are two projects

1. NearTerm emphasizes protoDUNE and simulation for FD/ND startup and will be used for the CCB 2024 report. 

The current json file is: 

    `NearTerm_2024-02-05-2040.json`

which uses

    'NearTerm_2024-02-05-2040_timeline.csv'



2. LongTerm emphasizes the breakdown of FD between different areas.  (It is not fully vetted yet)

Both should be analyzable with 2024-01-21-HMS.ipynb

* Previous versions


`DOE23-NDLAR_2023-12-11-2040` was used for the pre-CCB

It is replaced by `NearTerm_2024-02-05-2040.json`

Mike Kirby implemented the FD split that goes into LongTerm

his work was in CCB_Prep_2023-12-11-2040.json
